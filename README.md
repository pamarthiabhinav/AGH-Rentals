----------------------
**Stop the Running server**
	
	ctrl + c
	
**Admin Site**

Create superuser for admin site

	
	python manage.py createsuperuser
	
	

**Now run the server Again**
	
	python manage.py runserver


**Head to** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/aghar` The Admin Url Has Been Modified from admin to aghar

----------------------
**Note** : Although **Heading to The** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin` Will Also Show The Same Admin Panel But It Won't Give Any Response For Your Login Credentials. This Is Because Of django-Honeypot Which I Have Added Into The Project To Trick The Users With The Admin Panel
